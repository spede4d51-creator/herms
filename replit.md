# TeamHub - Project Migration

## Overview
TeamHub is a collaborative project management application originally built with Supabase and React. We are migrating it to Replit's environment with PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and Express.js backend.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Session-based auth with express-session
- **State Management**: React hooks and context

## Migration Progress
Currently migrating from Bolt/Supabase to Replit environment:
- ‚úÖ Created Drizzle schema based on Supabase tables
- ‚úÖ Implemented server-side storage layer with DatabaseStorage and MemStorage
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive API routes for all entities
- ‚úÖ Added session-based authentication
- üîÑ Currently removing Supabase dependencies from frontend
- ‚è≥ Need to update frontend hooks to use new API endpoints

## Key Features
- Project management with Kanban boards
- Task tracking with comments and assignments
- Document management with templates
- User profiles and project collaboration
- Activity logging and analytics
